# Tic Tac Toe using Minimax Algorithm

Created by Anurup De, as part of [The Mars Colonization Program](https://microsoft.acehacker.com/mars/) to demonstrate the behaviour of a rational agent using Minimax Algorithm.

## Description
The project was envisioned in the beginning as a 3D version of the popular tic tac toe game, with a 3\*3\*3 grid. That will be done shortly. As of now, the functionality of the basic layout is complete with the user able to select opponent, difficulty and starting player.

As a beginner to web development, this is my first project to be hosted on the web and the last few weeks have been a great learning experience.


## Usage
The app can be accessed from [https://anurup-de.github.io/](https://anurup-de.github.io/)

## Features to be added
1.Showing hints for the next player move. 2.Allowing minimax algorithm to search for best move upto a particular depth in the game tree. 3.Adding options for a 3D grid with alpha beta pruning to reduce calculation time. 4. Adding online multiplayer.
